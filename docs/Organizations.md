# Organizations

> For more information visit the [main page](../README.md)

An organization is like an account, with the difference that you can share it with others in the OnePoint Global Platform. Use your own account as a test environment and an Organization as the live environment. Work with other team members to coordinate your efforts.

To set up an organization use your DIY SMS Account and invite others to join it. Once they have joined they have access to its features allowing you all to manage and share its capabilities.
