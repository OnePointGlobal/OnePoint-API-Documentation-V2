# Stop Lists

> For more information visit the [main page](../README.md)

When a number responds to an SMS from OnePoint Global we look for a number of keywords an reply to them automatically in line with the countries standard requirements. These keywords are:

Keyword | Description
------- | -----------
STOP | A respondent usually replied to a message with STOP to indicate they no longer want any further messages from the number.
HELP | When a respondent is unsure as to what to do in some countries we have to respond to this keyword with a support message to contact us or use the STOP keyword.
INFO | Similar to the HELP keyword

## The Process
The STOP keyword triggers a special process within the OnePoint Global that consists of the following steps:

1. The mobile number is placed on the OnePoint Global STOP List
1. you are notified that this has taken place should you have a [Callback](Callbacks.md) set up.
